# GTA5-KiddionAssistMacro

![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/w/Terrobility/GTA5-KiddionAssistMacro.svg)

An AHK script for automating Kiddion's "Minimum Job Payout" method. Run it for just 3 hours - you'll earn **GTA $28M** and up to **1,400,000 RP** (optional).

The advantage of this method is that earnings are "legit" and don't have to be wiped from stats. Of course, it's always your choice.

## Background
Will update later. For now, check out this quote from Kiddion's FAQ:

> - ***"Does this menu have any money options?"***
  This mod has a strong focus on enhancing the regular gameplay, rather than add loads of money fast. However, there are a couple of ways to make some extra money. E.g. you can upgrade the npc money pickups in the game, get better money rewards for e.g. doing daily missions and mission jobs, do IE/MC/Bunker missions without cooldown and more. It is also possible to drop money on either yourself of players in sight (either near you or while spectating).
>
>   The best way at the moment is by using the "Minimum Job Payout" and start a mission like "Blow Up II" that's going to fail when you blow up all vehicles. When the mission has started, go to the World section in the mod menu and scroll to "Kill All Cars".
>
>   Now you can repeatedly:
>     - Press Numpad5 (kill all cars, failing the mission)
>     - Wait a couple of seconds (about 10 seconds)
>     - Press "PageUp" (Quick restart)
>     - Wait about 50 seconds for the mission to load.
>
>   This will make you 100k/minute. I hear you can tweak it to go even faster, with a 20s total for each cycle.
